# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21rst, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Used MATLAB to create base infrustracture for Fertility Awareness App. Specifically implemented and plotted basil body temperature data and period data. Tomorrow I will implement the cervical mucus feature, and also make fertility predictions based off data analysis. 

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot about MATLAB plotting and labelling points. Hopefully I can turn this into an app in a couple days. I'm satisfied with the progress I made in a pretty short period of time. About to work on Raspberry Pi stuff now.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
